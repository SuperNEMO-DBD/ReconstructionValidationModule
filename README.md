# ValidationModule readme

ValidationModule  is a Falaise pipeline module to process a selection of basic validation data and output a ROOT ntuple file, to be used for standard plots and metrics to validate data quality and basic reconstruction. The code is based on the SensitivityModule, but outputs completely different data. It should serve as an example for further validation modules; this one looks at reconstructed quantities like the number of reconstructed hits in an event or the reconstructed energy in a calorimeter.

## Files:

- ValidationModule.cpp
- ValidationModule.h
- CMakeLists.txt
- ValidationModuleExample.conf.in


## Description

Add to an flreconstruct pipeline to generate a ROOT ntuple file with some pertinent branches. To build it, do

``` console
$ ls
CMakeLists.txt                   SensitivityModule.h
README.md                        SensitivityModuleExample.conf.in
SensitivityModule.cpp
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<pathtoyourfalaiseinstall> ..
...
$ make
...
... If you are developing the module, you can test it by doing ...
$ make test
```

Note: if you get a QT5 error, you may need to specify the QT5 path when you run the cmake line, as given by `brew --prefix qt5-base`. For example, you can run:
``` console
$ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix qt5-base);$(brew --prefix)" ..
``` 

The build will create the `libValidationModule` shared library plus the example `flreconstruct` pipeline
script `ValidationModuleExample.conf`. Assuming that you have an `input.brio` file that contains
the `SD`, `CD`, `TCD`, `TTD` and `PTD` banks from the full reconstruction pipeline of `flreconstruct`
(up to and including gamma clustering), this can be run as:

``` console
... Assume we run in the build dir ...
$ ls
CMakeCache.txt                SensitivityModuleExample.conf
CMakeFiles                    cmake_install.cmake
Makefile
...
$ flreconstruct -i /path/to/input.brio -p ValidationModuleExample.conf
...
$ ls
CMakeCache.txt                ValidationModuleExample.conf
CMakeFiles                    cmake_install.cmake
Makefile                      Validation.root
```

The output file will by default be called `Validation.root` so donâ€™t run it multiple times concurrently in the same directory
or you will overwrite the previous file! Use the falaise flreconstruct pipeline instructions to see how to integrate this module in your pipeline.

There is now the option to configure the output filename in the module configuration file.
The final two lines of the configuration file must read:

[name="processing" type="ValidationModule"]
filename_out : string[1] = "my_filename.root"

## Types of branch

The ValidationParser will process the output tuples, making standard plots and (in future) comparing them to reference distributions. In order for it to do so, you need to follow some naming and formatting conventions when you create the branches. The branch name prefix tells the program how to process the information in the branch. The parser knows how to deal with the following types of branch:

**Simple Histogram branches:** prefix: `h_`
Example: `h_total_calorimeter_energy` The information in these branches will simply be histogrammed. A config file can be used to select the number of bins, and the minimum and maximum x values - otherwise they will be autogenerated. The config file can also give a title for the plots generated. If no title is specified, the parser will generate one by formatting the branch name, replacing underscores by spaces. For example, `h_calorimeter_hit_count` will get a default title of "Calorimeter hit count". An example config file line for a histogram variable is `h_cluster_count, Number of clusters, 10,0,10` which would tell you to entitle the plot for `h_cluster_count` "Number of clusters" and to use 10 bins, starting at 0 and going up to 10. Any of these fields can be left blank, or you can just not make an entry at all in the config file.




## Branches in this tuple
